# == Frontiers a2025.1.0: Scary Sights ==
A small update for the Halloween season, with some special Halloween content...obtainable year-round, of course!

_Special thanks to @jesterrcore for helping with this update - this was his idea! :D_

--------------------------
## Additions
### Blighted Birch
- A new wood set only obtainable from saplings found in Witch Huts
- Sports a unique, pale purple hue!
- The logs have unique properties; logs that haven't been cut yet will change color based on the time of day!
- Similar to Oak Trees, sometimes the leaves will drop a unique fruit...
### Pomegranates
- Drop from Blighted Birch Leaves
- Restores 1 hunger and 1.5 saturation
- Has a unique gimmick; when eaten, it will have a 75% chance of remaining in your inventory!
### Witch Hat
- Dropped by Witches with a 2.5% chance
- Has 380 durability
- Doesn't provide any armor points, but has a few special abilities when worn:
  - Potion drinking time is significantly reduced (25% the usual time)
  - The wearer will have the same damage resistances that a Witch normally does
  - Either of these effects will reduce the hat's durability by 3 each time
- Just like a Witch, the wearer will randomly produce little spell particles over their head!
### Jungle Spider
- Spawns in the [read the name]
- Exclusive to Hardmode
- Smaller than both Spiders & Cave Spiders, has more health & damage, and is faster!
  - To make it worse...it doesn't have glowing red eyes. Have fun. :)
- Getting bit on Normal difficulty and above inflicts the target with Weakness I
- Targets Chickens & untamed Parrots, because it's a Jungle Spider. It's gotta eat somehow.
- Will try and spin a Cobweb in an open space every ~3 minutes. You could make a farm out of this...
### Misc
- Spawn Eggs
  - Added spawn eggs for the Crawler and Jungle Spider 
- Splash Text
  - Playing on Halloween will now select from a list of unique splashes, not just "OOoooOOOoooo! Spooky!"
  - Added some new splashes to the base splash list
  - Added birthday splash texts for some important Frontiers team members

--------------------------
## Changes
### Quicksand
- Both variants can now be smelted into Glass in a Furnace
