## Vanilla Changes
### Desert Pyramid
- Now has a chance to generate a super secret basement. (this DID exist in part before, but was unfinished)
    - This basement will go down pretty far and include some unique loot!
    - Be careful though...I don't think the temple's old inhabitants would appreciate you just waltzing in and looting it...
