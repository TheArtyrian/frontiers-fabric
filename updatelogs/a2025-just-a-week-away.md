## Additions
### Fruitcake
- Crafted with fruit, milk, sugar, wheat, and eggs

- A single slice restores 6 hunger points
- When you can't eat anymore, you can throw it, dealing as much damage as it restores hunger
### Wreaths
- A new decorative block crafted from leaves & assorted materials
- Can be placed on the sides of solid blocks, leaves, and door faces
  - Will not have any collision on doors, and won't break when opening them
- Can be crafted out of every kind of leaves
- Can also be worn on your head. Why not.
