# == Frontiers a2025.0.2: A Taste of Things To Come ==

--------------------------
## Additions

--------------------------
### Crawler (WIP)
- A new, much deadlier cousin to the Creeper exclusive to Hardmode
  - Only spawns deep underground
  - Sports glowing blue eyes, making it stand out in the dark
  - Absolutely silent when walking, making it almost impossible to detect
  - Will slowly walk towards you while primed, like Beta Creepers. Don't let it near you.
  - Takes longer to explode, but its explosion is far deadlier
  - Will cause a fiery explosion if it's on fire
  - Drops Gunpower & Souls
- **Currently unfinished.** Expect more from it later:
  - A slightly unique model - about 1.5 blocks tall and fatter
  - Explosions will "infect" nearby blocks, if possible
  - Explosions will alert other nearby Crawlers
  - A spawn egg lol
### Souls
- Currently a WIP item, but will be an extremely important resource post-Wither
  - Only drops from Crawlers right now; more enemies will drop them later
  - A very good fuel for your Monster Bakeries, like Coal to a Furnace
  - Can currently be used to craft Phantasmic TNT
### Phantasmic TNT
- A TNT block that does far greater explosions
  - Crafted from 4 Gunpowder, 4 Sand, and 1 Soul
  - Its current functionality is temporary; will be a more unique tool later
### Eboncork (WIP)
- A new wood type native to the Crags
  - Only available in Creative for the time being
  - Unlike most wood, it generates in large "clusters" on the floors and ceilings of the Crags
    - Doesn't naturally generate yet, but the structures exist in the code! :D
  - One Eboncork makes 2 planks
  - Only planks exist at the moment - a full wood set (excluding a boat) will be added in a future patch
### Misc
- Added some small easter eggs for Artyrian because I hate him so much
  - The join/leave messages for this player will be...irritated
  - Artyrian will always drop a single Beetroot on death

_This is just a taste of what to expect in a later major Frontiers update - which will be centered around actually making Hardmode more challenging than it is now. Hope you look forward to it!_
